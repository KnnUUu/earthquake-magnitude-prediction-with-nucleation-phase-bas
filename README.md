# Earthquake Magnitude Prediction with Seismic Nucleation Phase based on Machine Learning
## Introduce
Verify one traditional seismic question with Machine Learning approaches and trying to implement on earthquake prediction
-	Data extraction from a national seismometer network called Hi-net, convert its format from SAC to CSV
-	Process, analyze, and create visualizations of data by using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib
-	Training with different Machine Learning methods like MLP, CNN, KNN and compare performances
-	Analyze the result using loss value, predicted magnitude, R2 and make conclusion
